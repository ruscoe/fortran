# Fortran Experiments

These are a few of my experiments in learning Fortran.

### Usage

I compile and run these on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS using
[GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), which you can install by running:

`sudo apt-get install gfortran`

Compile one of these scripts by running:

`gfortran hello.f90 -o hello`

Finally, run:

```
./hello
Hello world!
```
